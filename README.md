## Overview
### Description
The overall idea behind this app is provide a mobile way of comparing and contrasting prices of specific products among popular supermarkets, such as Target, Kroger, and Walmart.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:**
Finance 
- **Mobile:**
With required user stories, the app functions the same as if it was used on a desktop. However, it is a lot convient to check prices on a mobile phone rather than going home to check on the computer.
- **Story:**
It's a way to save money by shopping at cheaper locations which would be appreciated by friends and peers.
- **Market:**
Practically anyone who does grocery shopping would have a reason to be interested in this app which is a lot of people.
- **Habit:**
It's unlikely people would use this app in their free time nor is it addictive to like up prices for supermarket products. Users will primarily be consuming the app, not creating except for groccery list. 
- **Scope:**
A polish version of this app with extra features will likely be complicated and hard to complete by the end unless we commit alot of time. However, meeting the required user stories will still result a usable app with practical application
